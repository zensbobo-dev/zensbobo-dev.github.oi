            "Wait and Bleed"<br>
            The song blends aggressive nu-metal with haunting melodies and centers on themes of inner turmoil, transformation,
            and violent release. Corey Taylor (Slipknot's vocalist) has explained that it’s about having a nightmare where you realize
            you’re dead—and feeling both fear and acceptance of that transformation.

            "Duality"<br>
            "Duality" by Slipknot (2004, from the album Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses)) is one of their most well-known songs, 
            and while it’s still aggressive, it’s less surreal than Wait and Bleed—it’s more about coping with inner pain and the 
            push–pull between self-control and self-destruction.

            #3<br>
            "Psychosocial"<br>
            "Psychosocial" by Slipknot (2008, from the album All Hope Is Gone) is a mix of political anger, personal frustration, and Slipknot’s trademark dark imagery.
            It’s heavier and more anthemic than Duality—almost like a rallying cry against a corrupt and crumbling system, while also acknowledging inner decay.
